# LOOKABOUT

LOOKABOUT is a 2D horror game made in a week for SCREAM JAM 2023. It was initially developed in a small team for University of the Pacific's COMP-159 course, but has since continued solo development under myself.
Escape a dimly lit randomly generated labyrinth equipped with nothing but a time-sensitive flashlight. Try to stay out of sight from the monster that lurks within.
